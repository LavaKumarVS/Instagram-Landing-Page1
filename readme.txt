Overview
This project is a non-responsive clone of the Instagram webpage, created using basic HTML and CSS.
It showcases various web development concepts, including the box model, Bootstrap, hover effects, 
and advanced CSS techniques. While this clone closely resembles the Instagram interface, 
it is non-responsive and doesn't include JavaScript or backend functionality for user data storage. 
However, it serves as a valuable demonstration of your HTML and CSS skills.

HTML & CSS Mastery: The project demonstrates your proficiency in HTML and CSS, 
including structuring web content and styling elements.

Box Model: The box model is implemented to control element layout, spacing, 
and dimensions, ensuring an accurate visual representation.

Bootstrap Integration: Bootstrap is used to enhance the project's design and responsiveness, 
even though this version is non-responsive.

Hover Effects: Advanced CSS techniques are applied to create interactive hover effects, 
enhancing the user experience.

Future Development
This project is a great starting point for further development. Consider adding JavaScript for interactivity, implementing user authentication, and connecting to a backend database to store and retrieve user data.
